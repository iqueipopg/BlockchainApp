# Proyecto Blockchain 🔗⛓️

**Proyecto Blockchain** is a decentralized **blockchain application** where multiple nodes synchronize transactions into blocks using a **peer-to-peer network**. It features transaction processing, block mining, proof-of-work, and a RESTful API built with **Flask**.

This project was developed as part of a **Computer Science course** at the **Universidad Pontificia Comillas, ICAI**, for the **Engineering Mathematics** program.

## 📌 Project Overview

In **Proyecto Blockchain**, multiple nodes communicate over a decentralized network to:
- **Process transactions** securely and immutably.
- **Mine new blocks** using proof-of-work.
- **Ensure network consensus** via conflict resolution.
- **Expose a REST API** to interact with the blockchain.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Proyecto-Blockchain.git
   cd Proyecto-Blockchain
2. Run a blockchain node:
   ```sh
   python Blockchain_app.py
3. Use Postman or requests.py to interact with the API.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔗 Blockchain Mechanics
- Transactions are stored in **JSON format**.
- Blocks contain multiple transactions and are linked cryptographically.
- Each block's integrity is secured using **SHA-256 hashing**.
- The **proof-of-work** mechanism ensures secure and validated block addition.

### 🌍 Network & Consensus
- Nodes can **join and synchronize** automatically.
- Blockchain state is **maintained across all connected nodes**.
- A **conflict resolution algorithm** ensures all nodes agree on the longest valid chain.

## 📂 Project Structure

The **Proyecto Blockchain** directory is organized as follows:

```plaintext
├───backups
├───src
├───__MACOSX
│   └───Blockchain
│       ├───backups
│       └───__pycache__
└───__pycache__
```
**Note:**  
- The `backups/` folder stores copies of the blockchain for recovery.  
- The `src/` folder contains all the main Python files for the project.  
- The `__pycache__/` folders are automatically generated by Python and can be ignored.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

The **Proyecto Blockchain** application is built using the following technologies:

### 🔧 Development
- **Python** – Core programming language for blockchain logic.
- **Flask** – Web framework to create the REST API.
- **Requests** – Library for handling HTTP requests.
- **JSON** – Data format used for transactions and blocks.
- **Hashlib** – Python module for SHA-256 cryptographic hashing.

### 📡 Networking & API
- **Flask-RESTful** – Framework for designing API endpoints.
- **Postman** – Tool for testing API requests.
- **Sockets** – Enables node-to-node communication in a decentralized network.

### 🔐 Security & Blockchain Features
- **SHA-256** – Cryptographic hashing algorithm to ensure data integrity.
- **Proof-of-Work** – Mechanism to validate and secure blocks.
- **Conflict Resolution** – Ensures consensus among all network nodes.

### 🛠️ Additional Tools
- **Git** – Version control system for project tracking.
- **Ubuntu / Windows** – Supported operating systems for node deployment.
